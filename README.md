Clustering Ecuadorian provinces according to their covid-19 infections and population
==============================

Covid-19 strongly impacted the world and, of course, Ecuador. Authorities have implemented policies such as 
curfew so as to control the number of new infections. Can we improve the decisions taken based on similarities 
of provinces? How similar are provinces in terms of infections and population?

In this project a **machine learning** approach is used to segment those provinces using the K-Means algorithm.
The goal is to find groups that are not explicity labeled and may help authorities, specialy *COE Nacional*, 
to enhance their policies.

*Soon the article for this project will be available and shared here.*
*Further improvements in the structure of this project will be implemented as well*
